Limitations and things to be improved:
1. A database could be added, such as a Java H2 database, mySQL/SQLite, etc.

2. Currently most of the testing was done manually. A unit testing framework (JUnit) is implemented, however only at a very rudimentary proof-of-concept level. Currently missing exception handling and thorough tests that includes edge cases, etc.
